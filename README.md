# friend_finder

This is a compatibility-based friend finder application. The site will take in the results from your survey, then compare their answers with those in the friend array. The app then displays the name and photo of the friend with the best overall match. 

To use this app, you will need to run "npm i" in your terminal to install your Node dependencies.
